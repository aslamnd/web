Hello! This is my first post. I'm writing this because I just started a
personal kata project to improve my ruby: it's called **stendhal**.

It's a small test framework which tries to mimic the RSpec DSL, implemented
from scratch with my narrow understanding of _metaprogrammizing_. w00t!

##Why does the world need another test framework?

It doesn't. But since I recently got very interested in contributing to RSpec,
I thought it would be enlightening to try and build something from scratch, so
that I can get familiar with problems and patterns I would not use otherwise
simply because I don't know them.

You can check the source at [github.com/txus/stendhal][repo] and criticize as
you wish. In the end, it's all about learning!
