title: Skinny controllers
tagline: CRUD FTW
---

* Catchy entry: write less code at the end of the day
* Links to other posts explaining fat models and skinny controllers
* Skinny controllers, example PostsController
** Scaffold controller (OK for n00bs, sucks for day to day Rails development)
** inherited_resources controller
** decent_exposure controller

* Showdown
** Inherited resource more magical
** Comes with responders (bonus)
** Always fan of inherited resource, just discovered decent exposure and really
like it
** Less magic an also be good
** resource, collection VS expose
** belongs_to VS associated
** With decent exposure you still need to define create, update and destroy

* Try to integrate decent exposure with responders (makes sense?)
* Feedback
